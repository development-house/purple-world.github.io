## Installation & set up

1. Install Gatsby CLI:
    ```
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:purple-world/purple-world.github.io.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd purple-world
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   gatsby develop
   ```

## Building and running in production

1. Generate a full static production build:

   ```sh
   gatsby build
   ```

2. Preview the site as it will appear once deployed:

   ```sh
   gatsby serve
   ```

## Content editing

- Content displayed on page such as texts and buttons can be modified through YAML files located in `/src/config/` subfolders.

## Deployment

1. Push your commits to the `develop` branch. Github Actions will automatically build and deploy the site. Keep in mind there is a soft limit for the number of deploys - push your commits in batches.
